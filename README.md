# Overview

It is a simple

## Motivation

I wanted to build a simple application to leaen Node.js and Express.js. Often NoSQL and MongoDB in particular is used together with Node projects so it was a good chance to learn it (and Mongoose) too.

I have also used EJS as a view engine as I wanted to pratice using it.

## Tech used:

* Express.js on the back-end.
* [Mlab](https://mlab.com/) as a cloud DB with Mongoose.
* jQuery on the front-end to send the AJAX requests.
* EJS as a view engine.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Clone or download the repo.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. To launch app run `npm start`
